		<h3>1. Laptop</h3>
			<p>Having a portable computer when at college is a must because you need something where you can work anywhere. It doesn't have to be expensive you just need to be able to write papers and link to the Internet to upload assignments and if you have online classes it is necessary.</p>
			
		<h3>2. Flash Drive</h3>
			<p>College is going to be a whole bunch of late work sessions, jamming in homework between class' and work, and trying to remember if you saved that paper. A Flash Drive is your best friend because it is basically a second copy of all your work that you can pull up on any computer. I wouldn't recommend only saving your work on the flashdrive though especially if you tend to lose things.  
			</p>
			
	
			
		<h3>3. Binders/Folders</h3>
			<p>Organization is key in College because you are going to have notes from 5 different classes, along with lab sheets, worksheets, projects, and various assignments. Having a binder with dividers or folders for each class will cut down on the amount of paperwork that gets lost in your bag. 
			</p>
		
		<h3>4. Writing Utensils</h3>
			<p>It is best to be prepared so always carry around a pencil and a blue or black pen just in case you need to take some quick notes. Even if you take notes on your laptop it is important to always have these because what if something happens to your laptop then you have nothing to write the notes down with. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pencils
					<ul>
						<li>No.2 if possible</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Blue or Black Pens
					<ul>
						<li>The Only Acceptable Way of Writing a Paper</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				<li>Highlighters

				<li>Colored Pens

						<li>Color coded notes are your friend</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
			</ul>
			
		
		<h3>5. Paper</h3>
			<p>Probably the most basic school supply in the world, but it is also the most important.
