		This section exists for those individuals that live in a dorm setting. Often time, you move into a new
		setting like this, not knowing what to do or where to go; someone will help you with most of this, but one
		aspect they do not help you with is your room. They provide the bare necessities; table, bed and desk, but
		that just won't cut it for us.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		Here we'll list some ways that you can spruce up your room and maybe add a little bit of extra function to
		the place as well.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		Now, we discussed the fact that the bare essentials are there, but often times the rooms are left bare past that
		and need some extra attention.
		A great starting point could be to add some floor cushions to the space in your room for when you have company;
		extra seating can never hurt and it can add a pop of color to the room you're living in.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		A desk lamp is also a must if it is not provide for you. A proper lighting source for late studying is always
		needed, and it will cut down on extra expenses the college will charge you for.

		There's so much more we could tell you, but it would be easier to explore for your own benefit. Here are some
		locations you can go to get some more great ideas:
