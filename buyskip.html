			<h1>What to Buy and What to Skip</h1>
		<p>
		This section exists for those individuals that live in a dorm setting. Often time, you move into a new
		setting like this, not knowing what to do or where to go; someone will help you with most of this, but one
		aspect they do not help you with is your room. They provide the bare necessities; table, bed and desk, but
		that just won't cut it for us.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here we'll list some ways that you can spruce up your room and maybe add a little bit of extra function to
		the place as well.
		</p>

			<h3>1. Washi Tape</h3>
			<p>This colorful brand of tape can be used to decorate a myriad of different objects; you can border personal photos to give them more of a pop, create designs on the walls of your room or on the door, personalize shelves, refrigerators; the list goes on. Plus, this tape doesn't elave any residue behind
			when removed, so it's perfect for any temporary decorating jobs.</p>
			
			<h3>2. Wallpaper</h3>
			<p>Often times in dorms, the walls and the overall aesthetic feel of the room can be rather bland; the designers of the place don't exactly leave a lot to the imagination. But, with some wallpaper, you can jazz up the place a little with some more color and unique design!</p>
			
			<h3>3. Canvas Hamper</h3>
			<p>Carrying around a full-size basket hamper can be cumbersome, and let's face it, no one's going to lug around something like that anyway. Instead, get a canvas hamper; these types of hampers are easier on the eyes, match better with existing decor, and a vast majority have handles as an added convenience. They can come in various sizes as well, so it boils mainly to just picking a size!</p>
			
			<h3>4. Wreath</h3>
			<p>Yes, I know; the typical pre-conceived notions of wreaths come in. You can only hang them at Christmas and Thanksgiving. Well, no. Wreaths make an excellent and unique addition to the room as far as plant life is concerned. A wreath makes for an unorthodox and wonderful addition to the decor, especially if you get a real one. You'll have to water it, but it will smell wonderful all the time.
