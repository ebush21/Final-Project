		<h1>What to Buy and What to Skip</h1>
		<p>
		This section exists for those individuals that live in a dorm setting. Often time, you move into a new
		setting like this, not knowing what to do or where to go; someone will help you with most of this, but one
		aspect they do not help you with is your room. They provide the bare necessities; table, bed and desk, but
		that just won't cut it for us.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		Here we'll list some ways that you can spruce up your room and maybe add a little bit of extra function to
		the place as well.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		Now, we discussed the fact that the bare essentials are there, but often times the rooms are left bare past that
		and need some extra attention.
		A great starting point could be to add some floor cushions to the space in your room for when you have company;
		extra seating can never hurt and it can add a pop of color to the room you're living in.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		A desk lamp is also a must if it is not provide for you. A proper lighting source for late studying is always
		needed, and it will cut down on extra expenses the college will charge you for.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		There's so much more we could tell you, but it would be easier to explore for your own benefit. Here are some
		locations you can go to get some more great ideas:
