		<h1>How to Save on Food</h1>
		<p>
		Of all the problems that can occur in a college setting, from class orientations to making new friends to just
		learning how to fit in, often one of the most understated yet still important factors is how a person is going
		to feed themselves. Some of us don't have to worry about this if we're living in a situation where food is
		plentiful, but for some properly feeding oneself can be a challenge, and so we set out to try to help you with
		aspect of college life.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		One particularly good tip to keep in mind is to try to cut out snack food items and focus more on smaller quantities
		of healthy foods. Junk foods tend to cost more than healthy foods, especially when they are bought in bulk, and given
		that most junk foods have little to no nutritional value as it is, cutting them out entirely does some good for your
		body anyway.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		Saving coupons and using them during your trips is also recommended; yes, they can become a hassle to keep track
		of after a while, since they're so small and are usually just scrap paper, but keeping plenty in hand and using as many
		of them as you can on your shopping trip will help to cut the bill by a decent amount. The small price reductions
		add up.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		One more good tip to keep in mind would be to avoid impulse purchases as much as possible. It can be hard, since the
		temptation to buy unhealthy snack foods can be especially high, but cutting out the extra unneeded purchases can really help
		to keep your wallet heavier and your body happier.
