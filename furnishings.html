		In a college dorm life, it can be rather hard to try and get used to your new surroundings, especially if you
		don't have any possessions to really call your own in the new space you can inhabit. While not a necessity
		to success in the truest sense, it can help make dorm life easier with a personal flair added to your room,
		so we'll offer you some suggestions of what you can do to liven that room up.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		An unusual suggestion but still a good one; if your air conditioning vent is within close proximity, tape
		a dryer sheet over the opening and let the air blow through that to disperse a fresh scent into the air. It
		will help freshen up the air in the room and make your room feel a little less cramped.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		It can also help to bring some items from home that you are not likely to find in any standard store. Personal
		charms or crafts, special foods, maybe a book written in a different language or two; items like these can help
		lend a personal touch all your own to the room you're residing in.
